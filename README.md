<h4 align="center">This project presents an analysis of utilising multivariate regression techniques to predict car prices based on a set of variables. The repository encompasses the complete workflow, beginning with data cleaning and preprocessing, and culminating in the evaluation of model performance through the determination of the coefficient of determination (R-squared).</h4>

<h2 align="center">Key Highlights</h2>

###

<h6 align="left">Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The project addresses data quality issues, including handling missing values and irrelevant features. <br>Preprocessing techniques ensure the integrity and reliability of the dataset.<br><br>Multivariate Regression Modeling: A multivariate regression model is developed to predict car prices, incorporating an array of predictor variables. The model leverages techniques such as Lasso CV for feature selection, enabling the identification of influential features while mitigating the risk of overfitting.<br><br>Model Evaluation: Evaluation of model performance is conducted using established metrics such as the R-squared score. This provides insights into the predictive capabilities of the model and its ability to generalise to unseen data.<br><br>Feature Selection: The project explores different methodologies for feature selection, including Lasso CV and Random Forest Regression. By identifying and prioritising relevant features, the model achieves enhanced interpretability and predictive accuracy.</h6>
